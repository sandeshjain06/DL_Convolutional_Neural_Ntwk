# Convolutional Neural Networks** 


**Steps to Achieve CNN Algorithm**

    
# 1. Convolution Layer

    
    
# 2. Activation Layer
    
    
    
# 3. Pooling 
    
    Reduce the spatial size of input , making it easier to process and require less memory.
    
    Reduce no of parameters and makes training faster.
    
    Types of Pooling 
    1.Max Pooling      -  Max value of pixel from portion of images.
    2.Average Pooling  -  Average of all values from portion of the images.
    
    
# 4. Flattening
    
    Converts the multidimensional array to single dimensions.


# 5. Full Connection
  
    
    



# 6. Padding 

    Applying 0's at the edges.    


# 7. Stridding 

    Stride determines how many pixel shift
    
    When Stride = 1, filter moves 1 pixel at a time.
    When Stride = 2, filter moves 2 pixel at a time.
